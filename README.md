## Abstract

As advances in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal techniques continue to mature, the development of general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has surged, offering significant applications in interpreting natural images. However, the field of pathology has largely remained untapped, particularly in gathering high-quality data and designing comprehensive model frameworks. To bridge the gap in pathology MLLMs, we present PathAsst, a multimodal generative foundation AI assistant to revolutionize diagnostic and predictive analytics in pathology. The development of PathAsst involves three pivotal steps:  data acquisition, CLIP model adaptation, and the training of PathAsst's multimodal generative capabilities. Firstly, we collect over 207K high-quality pathology image-text pairs from authoritative sources. Leveraging the advanced power of ChatGPT, we generate over 180K instruction-following samples. Furthermore, we devise additional instruction-following data specifically tailored for invoking eight pathology-specific sub-models we prepared, allowing the PathAsst to effectively collaborate with these models, enhancing its diagnostic ability. Secondly, by leveraging the collected data, we construct PathCLIP, a pathology-dedicated CLIP, to enhance PathAsst's capabilities in interpreting pathology images. Finally, we integrate PathCLIP with the Vicuna-13b and utilize pathology-specific instruction-tuning data to enhance the multimodal generation capacity of PathAsst and bolster its synergistic interactions with sub-models. The experimental results of PathAsst show the potential of harnessing AI-powered generative foundation model to improve pathology diagnosis and treatment processes.

 We will continue to open source the following content as soon as possible:

- [x] A trained ConvNext-Tiny model specifically designed for selecting pathology images.

- [x] An annotated 2K bounding box data for subfigure detection, alongside the trained YOLOv7 model.

- [x] Scripts for automated extraction of image-text pairs from PDF books.

- [x] A fine-tuned LLaMA-7B model intended for sub-caption splitting and caption refining.

- [x] A collection of over 200K pathology PubMed image-text pairs.

In addition, we plan to train and release four versions of the CLIP model, which will be fine-tuned using more than 200K pathology samples, including clip-vit-base-patch16, clip-vit-base-patch32, clip-vit-large-patch14, and clip-vit-large-patch14-336.
